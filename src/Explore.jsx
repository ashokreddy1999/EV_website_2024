      <p>BEVs are also known as All-Electric Vehicles (AEV). Electric Vehicles using BEV technology run 
        entirely on a battery-powered electric drivetrain. The electricity used to drive the vehicle is stored
         in a large battery pack which can be charged by plugging into the electricity grid. The charged battery pack 
         then provides power to one or more electric motors to run the electric car.
